System Software Lecture Series (UCF)
------------------------------------

I was looking for some info on Recursive Decent Parsers, and I stumbled on this lecture series from the University of
Central Florida for a Software Systems class. The syllabus-- along with lecture notes and info about the class compiler
project-- is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/cop3402fall19/syllabus>`_.


Lecture 1: Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A big chunk of this video is a history of operating systems, but there's some good general information about the design of the
Linux kernel in there. The rest of it is about how operating systems work, how they bootstrap themselves, how loaders work, etc.
I work on developer and infrastructure tooling for my job, so this is all nice to know about.
