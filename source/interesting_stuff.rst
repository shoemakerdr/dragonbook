Interesting Stuff I've Found
============================

This is just a list of interesting stuff I've found that I haven't really gotten a change to look into yet. If
you're anything like me, you probably have a lot of bookmarks on your browser or a Google docs spreadsheet of
things you wanna check out at a later date. This page serves that same purpose, but I'm sharing it!

Programming from A to Z
-----------------------

For those of you familiar with the Youtube channel `the Coding Train <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw>`_,
this is a free course by host Daniel Shiffman. From the description:

    This course focuses on programming strategies and techniques behind procedural analysis and generation of text-based
    data. We'll explore topics ranging from evaluating text according to its statistical properties to the automated
    production of text with probabilistic methods to text visualization. Students will learn server-side and client-side
    JavaScript programming and develop projects that can be shared and interacted with online. There will be weekly
    homework assignments as well as a final project.
