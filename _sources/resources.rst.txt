System Software Lecture Series (UCF)
------------------------------------

I was looking for some info on Recursive Decent Parsers, and I stumbled on this lecture series from the University of
Central Florida for a Software Systems class. The syllabus-- along with lecture notes and info about the class compiler
project-- is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/cop3402fall19/syllabus>`_.


Lecture 1: Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The first part of this video is a history of operating systems, but there's some good general information about the design of the
Linux kernel in there. Then the professor talks about how operating systems work, how they bootstrap themselves, how the loader works,
etc.

Around the 30min mark, he starts talking about tools like objdump, how to compile C code, and how to use Make. When I first started
teaching myself programming, I remember seeing a lot of Makefiles around, and I couldn't make heads or tails of them. I was super
intimidated by them. Eventually, I dug around and figure out enough about Make to not be scared of it. I WISH I would've seen this kind
of intro to Make when I was learning this; it would've been INVALUABLE. It also would've saved me time on stupid errors I couldn't figure
out (Hello, tabs!). Anyways, this section is a decent primer for anyone who wants to work in build/infra/developer tools. It's nice to
know the history, but also these tools are still out there and in regular use. If you build lots of C/C++ libraries, you'll probably be
very familiar with a lot of these tools.

Around 45min, the lecturer talks about LLVM and it's intermediate representation (IR). Super interesting stuff. He doesn't go super in-depth
about it, but if you're interested in very deep discussion of LLVM's architecture, check out Chris Lattner's chapter about it in the
`"Architecture of Open Source Applications" <https://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html>`_ online book.

I'll add more links and thoughts later as I watch these videos...
